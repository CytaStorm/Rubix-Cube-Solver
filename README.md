Gujixers’ Rubik's Cube Solver
   What’s the point of learning how to solve a Rubik’s Cube when you can use a computer program to do it for you? This program will allow users to input colors on an unfolded Rubik’s Cube. They will be able to click on individual squares to set the colors. This program will incorporate Processing and solve the Rubik’s Cube, as well as show the user what steps are necessary, as well as show each step in solving the cube.

  This program’s MVP will be an algorithm to solve the Rubik’s Cube using the Beginner’s Method, a slower method. Users will be able to plot their scrambled cube, and the program will return a list of required steps. 
  The nice-to-have-features will be different algorithms and different cubes to solve, as well as UI/UX Improvements.

# Gujixers’ Rubik's Cube Solver

What’s the point of learning how to solve a Rubik’s Cube when you can use a computer program to do it for you? 

This program will allow users to input moves to a Rubik’s cube, visualized to the user as a net. Users will be able to scramble and solve a cube, as well as input specific moves to the cube. This program will use Processing and solve the Rubik’s Cube, as well as show the user what steps are necessary. Users should know the basic cube notations (F, R, U, L, B, D and F’, R', U', L', B', D').
